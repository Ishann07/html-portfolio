<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Driven by my passion for designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems, processes, components, and programs, I made the decision to pursue a career in Computer Science. My insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding of the field that shapes the world has always been a driving force in my academic journey.</p>

<p>At IDeaS, as an Associate Software Developer, I actively contributed to the development and enhancement of software solutions. My proficiency in agile methodologies, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and strong understanding of technologies such as Spring Boot, Postman, APIs, and CRUD operations enabled me to deliver high-quality software features and effectively troubleshoot any issues that arose during the development process.</p>
